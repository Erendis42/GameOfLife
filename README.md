# Conway's Game Of Life
C# WPF implementation

This is an old university project, with the simplest (and probably the least effective) algorithm to calculate next generations imaginable.

### Usage:
Download the executable and the "presets" folder. You can load the presets by clicking File -> Open.

Please do not to open random other files, also use your own presets only if you know what you are doing!

The .zip file contains the solution as I resurrected the old code in Visual Studio 2022 right now. (27 September, 2023)

A much more sophisticated solution for calculating the next generation can be found here: https://golly.sourceforge.io/
