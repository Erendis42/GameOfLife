This is an old university project, with the simplest algorithm to calculate next generations imaginable.

### Usage:

- Download the precompiled version for Windows 64-bit [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10ajqbP6kPEjyj6d2h8xzJoHAyHj5BhVw/view?usp=sharing)
- Double click the .exe file.
- When the warning message pops up, click "Run Anyway".
- You can load the presets by clicking File -> Open. (Please do not try to open random files. Also, use your own presets only if you know what you are doing!)

A much more sophisticated implementation (with memoization, infinite canvas, etc.) can be found [here](https://golly.sourceforge.io/)
